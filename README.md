# GifTastic

*   This application uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of users choice.

*   When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and          places them on the page.

*   When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

*   Under every gif, displayed is its rating

* "Add a bird" takes the value from the user input and adds the button for that corresponding topic on the page.

* App is fully mobile responsive.

* "Load 10 more Gif's button" allows users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.
   * Each request ADDs 10 gifs to the page upto 400 for one particular topic.

* Users can add their favorite gifs to a `favorites` section by clicking the HEART icon under the image.
